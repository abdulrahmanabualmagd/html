Flexbox:

    - Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model designed for laying out items within a container along a single direction (either horizontally or vertically).
    - It provides properties for distributing space among items, aligning items, and controlling the order of items.
    - Flexbox is particularly useful for creating dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
    - Properties like flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and flex play key roles in flexbox layouts.


Code:

    .container {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
    }

    .item {
        flex: 1;
        height: 100px;
        background-color: #ccc;
        margin: 5px;
    }
